      <p>
        The rivers of Serbia belong to three catchment areas, each of which is
        Black Sea, Adriatic and Aegean are tributary. Lying there
        over 90% of the flowing waters in the catchment area of ​​the Danube. Only in the southeast
        drains the Pčinja to the Aegean Sea and in the south-west of the Beli Drim (White Drim) to the Adriatic Sea.
        On the mountain range of the Crnoljeva is the hydrographic one
        Border between the drainage areas of the Adriatic, Aegean and Black Seas.
        From the highest point of Drmanska glava (<i> 1,367 m </i>) the rivers run over the White
        Drim into the Adriatic Sea, over the Sitnica and Ibar into the Black Sea and over the tributaries of the
        Lepenac to the Vardar and the Aegean Sea. Due to a hydrographic feature, the
        Nerodimka in the catchment system of the Sitnica in Kosovo through a bifurcation even in two seas.

        The Vojvodina Plain is the largest hydrographic node in Europe.
        Here rivers from the Alps, Central Europe, Dinarides and Carpathians coincide.
        With the Drava (on the Croatian side), Tisza, Sava and Danube everyone meets
        navigable rivers of Southeastern Europe in Vojvodina. The one that used to be at risk of flooding
        Region is due to the major project of the Danube-Tisza-Danube Canal and lowering of the groundwater level
        but no longer endangered today.

      <h3>Rivers</h3>
      <p>
        The rivers of Serbia are among the most meandering in the north of the country
        mighty lowland currents of the Danube Plain, in the central, western and eastern
        Area to the mountain rivers of the Dinarides and Carpathians, as well as in Kosovo to the small lowland rivers.
        Only the Sava, Tisza and Danube are continuously navigable, but also sections of the route at the mouths
        the Drina and the Great Morava as well as the numerous large reservoirs.
        The once widespread rafting on the Drina and Morava has been discontinued in the 1960s.
        In particular the mountain rivers which often consist of carbonates and in particular
        Dinarides built on limestone are characterized by numerous gorge-rich stretches
        which represent significant obstacles to traffic. Even the Danube was still up
        At the beginning of the 20th century in the Carpathian breakthrough of the Iron Gate through rapids
        and blockages in Veliki Kazan represent a significant obstacle to shipping.
        The flowing waters of the mountains belong to the rain and snow regimes,
        Sava and Danube to the combined systems (snow, rain, glacier melt water (Danube only)).
        The maximum levels in the runoff are measured for the Drina and Great Morava in April, for the Danube in May.
        Floods are frequent and very often catastrophic, especially on the Drina and Morava.
        On March 27, 1896, the Drina achieved a historical maximum discharge of over 9,000 m³ / s.
        The danger of flooding on the Drina is through despite the numerous regulating reservoirs
        a heavy snowmelt in their high mountain catchment area (Prokletije, Durmitor) and the
        heavy rainfall in spring is not always under control. But the Morava poses
        the far greater problem today. There are neither protective retention basins here.
        significant dykes were built. Morava regulation was planned for a long time, but was never implemented.
        Danube and Sava have numerous retention areas on their course (e.g. Obedska bara).
        The Danube and Tisza are also protected by the runoff regulation system
        Danube-Tisza-Danube Canal protected. The annual floods are therefore rarely critical today.
        Catastrophic floods on the Danube only occur after long decades.
        The last great flood of 1965 turned out to be mild,
        because the threat to Novi Sad at that time from floods of agricultural land could be averted.
        When the Danube froze over, the last time there was a large flood in 1956 when ice floes left the area.
        Several icebreakers are available for such cases.
        The Danube flows through the country over a length of 588 km. In her middle
        Section through Serbia it includes the following rivers: Theiss, Save, Tamiš, Morava, Mlava, Nera, Pek and the Timok.
        The Tisza in turn receives the Begej. The Save takes on the Drina and the Kolubara.
         The Morava includes the Toplica, the Nišava and the Zapadna Morava. The Drina absorbs the Lim
         which in turn absorbs the Uvac. The Zapadna Morava holds the Djetinja, Moraviaca and the Ibar, which holds the Sitnica. <Div class = "clickable"> <i> Clickable image </i> </div> </p>

      <h3> Lakes </h3>
      <p> lakes
    Serbia's lakes are mostly artificial. The natural lakes are very small in area.
     The lakes Palić (5 km²) and Ludaš in northern Serbia (near Subotica) should be mentioned.
     The largest artificially created lake in Serbia is the Djerdapsee (253 km²) on the border with Romania.
     It is the largest lake in the country. Other reservoirs would be the Vlasina lake in the southeast,
     the Gazivodeee on the river Ibar, the Zlatarsee on the Uvac, as well as the Perućacsee and the Zvorniksee,
     both on the Drina, on the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina.
